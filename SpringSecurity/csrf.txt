CSRF
====
In Spring Security, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection is enabled by default to prevent malicious third-party websites from making unwanted requests on behalf of authenticated users. However, you might see CSRF disabled in certain cases, especially in REST APIs or development environments.

Why CSRF is sometimes disabled:
==============================
1. Stateless REST APIs
CSRF attacks target applications that use cookies for authentication (like session-based logins).
REST APIs are usually stateless and use tokens (like JWT) in headers, not cookies.
Since there's no session or cookie-based auth, CSRF protection is not needed.
That’s why you’ll often see:

http.csrf().disable();
