RESTFul web service
===================
REST stands form representational state transfer

A RESTful web service is a service that runs on web server that:
1. Follows REST architecture style
2. Uses standard HTTP methods(get,post,put,delete,patch,etc)
3. Exposes data as resources, typically in JSON or XML

Key Concepts in REST:
====================
1. Resource:Everything is a resource (e.g., user, product)
2. URI:Each resource is identified by a URI (e.g., /users/101)
3. Stateless:Server does not remember client state between requests
4. HTTP Methods:Uses standard methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
5. Representations:Resource data is sent as JSON or XML (representation of the state)
