Web services
============
Web services are software components that allow different applications (possibly built in different languages or running on different platforms) to communicate over a network, typically the internet, using standard protocols.
For example react front-end is communicating with java back-end over a netwrok
Creating web services means, creating RESTFul APIs
Back-end will serve RESTFul APIs to front-end

Types of Web Services:
======================
1. SOAP Web Services
a)Protocol-based (uses XML)
b)Heavier, with strict standards (WSDL, SOAP)
Example: Enterprise banking systems

2. RESTful Web Services (Most common today)
a)Resource-based (uses HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
b)Lightweight and fast
c)Data format: mostly JSON and XML
Example: APIs used by mobile apps, websites, etc.
